1. Since the data is very imbalanced SMOTE may be a good option to try 

2.Correlation is very low and non informative to determine anything

3. most continuous variables are right skewed. This shows presence of high outliers

4.Data of the PAY column contains 0 and -2 which are not defined. Information given about dataset maybe
 wrong or theymay correspond the duly payed group i.e -1. So it is safer to try with given data and also 
by imputing -1 in place of 0 and -2. 

5.Without any changes in the data when the models are fit it seems that random forest and lightgbm boosting 
algorithms give the highest accuracy. But the roc auc score is very low. This is probably because of 
imbalanced data which is leading to low sensitivity or tpr

6. Logistic regression and Naive bayes seems to be very bad
